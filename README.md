# wp-plugin
This repository contains a custom developed Wordpress Plugin called "WP Movies" that allows users to add and list movies as custom post types in the WordPress admin area. 
Each movie contains a title, an image, director, and actor information for easy management. You can now easily add, edit, and delete movies from the admin interface.
Additionally, there is a widget to display movies on the front end of the website. 
The widget is fully configurable, allowing you to enter a custom Widget Title and specify the number of movies you want to display on the widget.
